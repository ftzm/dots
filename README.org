* Nixos System Configuration
This repository contains nix configurations and dotfiles for my home lab and personal workstations.

The configuration for all machines is defined in a [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][nix flake]]. Workstations load configurations directly via the ~nixos-rebuild switch --flake~ command, while the servers are deployed remotely using [[https://github.com/serokell/deploy-rs][deploy-rs]].
