## Upgrading

A major chart version change indicates that there is an incompatible breaking change needing manual actions.

### From Chart versions < 3.0.0

* Breaking Change *
The chart now runs Tempo 3.0 in monolithic mode. Tempo 3.0 removes the ingester and the
compactor, and the live-store takes over the recent-data path. Monolithic mode still runs
every component in one process and needs no Kafka. Read the
[Tempo 3.0 release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/release-notes/v3-0/) and the
[migration guide](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/set-up-for-tracing/setup-tempo/migrate-to-3/)
before you upgrade.

What changed in the chart:

* `tempo.ingester` is removed. Use `tempo.liveStore` for the equivalent settings of the new
  live-store. The live-store writes its WAL under `/var/tempo`, so the existing persistent
  volume still covers it.
* `tempo.retention` now renders into
  `backend_scheduler.provider.compaction.compaction.block_retention`. The `compactor:` config
  block is gone. The value and its meaning do not change. `tempo.backendScheduler` and
  `tempo.backendWorker` tune the rest of compaction. Settings in `tempo.backendScheduler` win
  over `tempo.retention`.
* `tempo.memBallastSizeMbs` is removed, because Tempo 3.0 dropped the
  `-mem-ballast-size-mbs` flag.
* `tempo.metricsGenerator.traces_storage` is removed, together with the `local_blocks`
  processor. Tempo 3.0 does not support that processor. Remove `local-blocks` from
  `metrics_generator.processors` in your overrides before you upgrade.

If you set `config` or any of the removed values yourself, migrate your own file first. The
`tempo-cli migrate config --mode=monolithic old-config.yaml` command does the conversion.

### From Chart versions < 2.0.0
* Breaking Change *
The minimum required Kubernetes version is now 1.25. All references to deprecated APIs have been removed.

### From Chart versions < 1.22.0
* Breaking Change *
Please be aware that we've updated the Tempo version to 2.8, which includes some breaking changes
We recommend reviewing the [release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/release-notes/v2-8/) before upgrading.

### From Chart versions < 1.21.1
* Breaking Change *
In order to be consistent with other projects and documentations, the default port has been changed from 3100 to 3200.

### From Chart versions < 1.19.0
* Breaking Change *
In order to reduce confusion, the overrides configurations have been renamed as below.

`global_overrides` =>  `overrides` (this is where the defaults for every tenant is set)
`overrides` => `per_tenant_overrides` (this is where configurations for specific tenants can be set)

### From Chart versions < 1.17.0

Please be aware that we've updated the Tempo version to 2.7, which includes some breaking changes
We recommend reviewing the [release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/release-notes/v2-7/) before upgrading.

### From Chart versions < 1.12.0

Upgrading to chart 1.12.0 will set the memberlist cluster_label config option. During rollout your cluster will temporarily be split into two memberlist clusters until all components are rolled out.
This will interrupt reads and writes. This config option is set to prevent cross talk between Tempo and other memberlist clusters.

### From Chart versions < 1.2.0

Please be aware that we've updated the minor version to Tempo 2.1, which includes breaking changes.
We recommend reviewing the [release notes](https://github.com/grafana/tempo/releases/tag/v2.1.0/) before upgrading.

### From Chart versions < 1.0.0

Please note that we've incremented the major version when upgrading to Tempo 2.0. There were a large number of
changes in this release (breaking and otherwise). It is encouraged to review the [release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/release-notes/v2-0/)
and [1.5 -> 2.0 upgrade guide](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/setup/upgrade/) before upgrading.

### From Chart versions < 0.7.0

Upgrading from pre 0.7.0 will, by default, move your trace storage from `/tmp/tempo/traces` to `/var/tempo/traces`.
This will cause Tempo to lose trace history. If you would like to retain history just copy the contents from the
old folder to the new.
